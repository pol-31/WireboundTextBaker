8 columns, 12 rows, 96 chars max; name and font_path are necessary.
name = no extension, no parent path; filename = name + extension;
path = filename + parent path.
If no resolution provided (or it's invalid) - used default value 512.
___ Symbols to generate may be wrapped in "" and can contain indents;
should be represented in hex format with 6 symbols (e.g. 0xFFFF) and
separated by comma ','.
Symbols ranges described with '-' (inclusive), e.g. 0x0020-0x007E.
___ autogen('y') or glyph mapping data:
- use 'y' to autogen symbols (everything else considered as "no");
- if file is already generated, glyph mapping data store here.
autogen symbols don't contain ASCII symbols (they always
should be stored in separate bitmap). Width data represented as:
float factor (uint32), int width min (uint32), int height (uint32),
int full height (uint32) - including between-line space and
std::vector<uint8_t> widths (uint8).
___ localization path is optimal and used for symbols autogen
  (it would be scanned for more frequent chars).
